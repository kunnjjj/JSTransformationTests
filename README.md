### Tests candidate in JS everyday functions, and algorithms
This is inspired from "Conjoint Page" in Survey(CFM). We have similar functions written in spr-main-web.
Since difficulty of actual problem is high, we have made 3 parts in the questions, all of which are attemptable for desired position.
Difficulty of problem "getValidProductsCount" can be further increased to match that of spr-main-web.

### Steps to Attempt

1. After installation, candidate needs to write function in "src/candidateSolutions/[problem]" files.

2. "src/__tests__/conjointProblem/[problem]/[problem].spec.js" imports functions from these files, and tests them against pre-written test cases.
